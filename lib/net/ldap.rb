  # == Net::LDAP
  #
  # This library provides a pure-Ruby implementation of the
  # LDAP client protocol, per RFC-1777.
  # It can be used to access any server which implements the
  # LDAP protocol.
  #
  # Net::LDAP is intended to provide full LDAP functionality
  # while hiding the more arcane aspects
  # the LDAP protocol itself, and thus presenting as Ruby-like
  # a programming interface as possible.
  # 
  # === Quick-start for the Impatient
  #  require 'rubygems'
  #  require 'net/ldap'
  #  
  #  ldap = Net::LDAP.new :host => server_ip_address,
  #       :port => 389,
  #       :auth => {
  #             :method => :simple,
  #             :username => "cn=manager,dc=example,dc=com",
  #             :password => "opensesame"
  #       }
  #
  #  filter = Net::LDAP::Filter.eq( "cn", "George*" )
  #  treebase = "dc=example,dc=com"
  #  
  #  ldap.search( :base => treebase, :filter => filter ) do |entry|
  #    puts "DN: #{entry.dn}"
  #    entry.each do |attribute, values|
  #      puts "   #{attribute}:"
  #      values.each do |value|
  #        puts "      --->#{value}"
  #      end

  # == Quick introduction to LDAP
  #
  # We're going to provide a quick and highly informal introduction to LDAP
  # terminology and
  # typical operations. If you're comfortable with this material, skip
  # ahead to "How to use Net::LDAP." If you want a more rigorous treatment
  # of this material, we recommend you start with the various IETF and ITU
  # standards that control LDAP.
  #
  # === Entities
  # LDAP is an Internet-standard protocol used to access directory servers.
  # The basic search unit is the <i>entity,</i> which corresponds to
  # a person or other domain-specific object.
  # A directory service which supports the LDAP protocol typically
  # stores information about a number of entities.
  #
  # === Principals
  # LDAP servers are typically used to access information about people,
  # but also very often about such items as printers, computers, and other
  # resources. To reflect this, LDAP uses the term <i>entity,</i> or less
  # commonly, <i>principal,</i> to denote its basic data-storage unit.
  # 
  #
  # === Distinguished Names
  # In LDAP's view of the world,
  # an entity is uniquely identified by a globally-unique text string
  # called a <i>Distinguished Name,</i> originally defined in the X.400
  # standards from which LDAP is ultimately derived.
  # Much like a DNS hostname, a DN is a "flattened" text representation
  # of a string of tree nodes. Also like DNS (and unlike Java package
  # names), a DN expresses a chain of tree-nodes written from left to right
  # in order from the most-resolved node to the most-general one.
  #
  # If you know the DN of a person or other entity, then you can query
  # an LDAP-enabled directory for information (attributes) about the entity.
  # Alternatively, you can query the directory for a list of DNs matching
  # a set of criteria that you supply.
  #
  # === Attributes
  #
  # In the LDAP view of the world, a DN uniquely identifies an entity.
  # Information about the entity is stored as a set of <i>Attributes.</i>
  # An attribute is a text string which is associated with zero or more
  # values. Most LDAP-enabled directories store a well-standardized
  # range of attributes, and constrain their values according to standard
  # rules.
  #
  # A good example of an attribute is <tt>cn,</tt> which stands for "Common Name."
  # In many directories, this attribute is used to store a string consisting of
  # a person's first and last names. Most directories enforce the convention that
  # an entity's <tt>cn</tt> attribute have <i>exactly one</i> value. In LDAP
  # jargon, that means that <tt>cn</tt> must be <i>present</i> and
  # <i>single-valued.</i>
  #
  # Another attribute is <tt>mail,</tt> which is used to store email addresses.
  # (No, there is no attribute called "email," perhaps because X.400 terminology
  # predates the invention of the term <i>email.</i>) <tt>mail</tt> differs
  # from <tt>cn</tt> in that most directories permit any number of values for the
  # <tt>mail</tt> attribute, including zero.
  #
  #
  # === Tree-Base
  # We said above that X.400 Distinguished Names are <i>globally unique.</i>
  # In a manner reminiscent of DNS, LDAP supposes that each directory server
  # contains authoritative attribute data for a set of DNs corresponding
  # to a specific sub-tree of the (notional) global directory tree.
  # This subtree is generally configured into a directory server when it is
  # created. It matters for this discussion because most servers will not
  # allow you to query them unless you specify a correct tree-base.
  #
  # Let's say you work for the engineering department of Big Company, Inc.,
  # whose internet domain is bigcompany.com. You may find that your departmental
  # directory is stored in a server with a defined tree-base of
  #  ou=engineering,dc=bigcompany,dc=com
  # You will need to supply this string as the <i>tree-base</i> when querying this
  # directory. (Ou is a very old X.400 term meaning "organizational unit."
  # Dc is a more recent term meaning "domain component.")
  #
  # === LDAP Versions
  # (stub, discuss v2 and v3)
  #
  # === LDAP Operations
  # The essential operations are: #bind, #search, #add, #modify, #delete, and #rename.
  # ==== Bind
  # #bind supplies a user's authentication credentials to a server, which in turn verifies
  # or rejects them. There is a range of possibilities for credentials, but most directories
  # support a simple username and password authentication.
  #
  # Taken by itself, #bind can be used to authenticate a user against information
  # stored in a directory, for example to permit or deny access to some other resource.
  # In terms of the other LDAP operations, most directories require a successful #bind to
  # be performed before the other operations will be permitted. Some servers permit certain
  # operations to be performed with an "anonymous" binding, meaning that no credentials are
  # presented by the user. (We're glossing over a lot of platform-specific detail here.)
  #
  # ==== Search
  # Calling #search against the directory involves specifying a treebase, a set of <i>search filters,</i>
  # and a list of attribute values.
  # The filters specify ranges of possible values for particular attributes. Multiple
  # filters can be joined together with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
  # A server will respond to a #search by returning a list of matching DNs together with a
  # set of attribute values for each entity, depending on what attributes the search requested.
  # 
  # ==== Add
  # #add operation specifies a new DN and an initial set of attribute values. If the operation
  # succeeds, a new entity with the corresponding DN and attributes is added to the directory.
  #
  # ==== Modify
  # #modify specifies an entity DN, and a list of attribute operations. #modify is used to change
  # the attribute values stored in the directory for a particular entity.
  # #modify may add or delete attributes (which are lists of values) or it change attributes by
  # adding to or deleting from their values.
  # There are three easier methods to modify an entry's attribute values:
  # #add_attribute, #replace_attribute, and #delete_attribute.
  #
  # ==== Delete
  # #delete operation specifies an entity DN. If it succeeds, the entity and all its attributes
  # is removed from the directory.
  #
  # ==== Rename (or Modify RDN)
  # #rename (or #modify_rdn) is an operation added to version 3 of the LDAP protocol. It responds to
  # the often-arising need to change the DN of an entity without discarding its attribute values.
  # In earlier LDAP versions, the only way to do this was to delete the whole entity and add it
  # again with a different DN.
  #
  # #rename works by taking an "old" DN (the one to change) and a "new RDN," which is the left-most
  # part of the DN string. If successful, #rename changes the entity DN so that its left-most
  # node corresponds to the new RDN given in the request. (RDN, or "relative distinguished name,"
  # denotes a single tree-node as expressed in a DN, which is a chain of tree nodes.)
  #
  # == How to use Net::LDAP
  #
  # To access Net::LDAP functionality in your Ruby programs, start by requiring
  # the library:
  #
  #  require 'net/ldap'
  #
  # If you installed the Gem version of Net::LDAP, and depending on your version of
  # Ruby and rubygems, you _may_ also need to require rubygems explicitly:
  #
  #  require 'rubygems'
  #  require 'net/ldap'
  #
  # Most operations with Net::LDAP start by instantiating a Net::LDAP object.
  # The constructor for this object takes arguments specifying the network location
  # (address and port) of the LDAP server, and also the binding (authentication)
  # credentials, typically a username and password.
  # Given an object of class Net:LDAP, you can then perform LDAP operations by calling
  # instance methods on the object. These are documented with usage examples below.
  #
  # The Net::LDAP library is designed to be very disciplined about how it makes network
  # connections to servers. This is different from many of the standard native-code
  # libraries that are provided on most platforms, which share bloodlines with the
  # original Netscape/Michigan LDAP client implementations. These libraries sought to
  # insulate user code from the workings of the network. This is a good idea of course,
  # but the practical effect has been confusing and many difficult bugs have been caused
  # by the opacity of the native libraries, and their variable behavior across platforms.
  #
  # In general, Net::LDAP instance methods which invoke server operations make a connection
  # to the server when the method is called. They execute the operation (typically binding first)
  # and then disconnect from the server. The exception is Net::LDAP#open, which makes a connection
  # to the server and then keeps it open while it executes a user-supplied block. Net::LDAP#open
  # closes the connection on completion of the block.

    # Adds a new entry to the remote LDAP server.
    # Supported arguments:
    # :dn :: Full DN of the new entry
    # :attributes :: Attributes of the new entry.
    #
    # The attributes argument is supplied as a Hash keyed by Strings or Symbols

    # the server-specific constraints.

    #
    # Modifies the attribute values of a particular entry on the LDAP directory.
    # Takes a hash with arguments. Supported arguments are:
    # :dn :: (the full DN of the entry whose attributes are to be modified)
    # :operations :: (the modifications to be performed, detailed next)
    #
    # This method returns True or False to indicate whether the operation
    # succeeded or failed, with extended information available by calling
    # #get_operation_result.
    #
    # The LDAP protocol provides a full and well thought-out set of operations
    # for changing the values of attributes, but they are necessarily somewhat complex
    # and not always intuitive. If these instructions are confusing or incomplete,
    # please send us email or create a bug report on rubyforge.
    #
    # The :operations parameter to #modify takes an array of operation-descriptors.
    # Each individual operation is specified in one element of the array, and
    # most LDAP servers will attempt to perform the operations in order.
    #
    # Each of the operations appearing in the Array must itself be an Array
    # with exactly three elements:
    # an operator:: must be :add, :replace, or :delete
    # an attribute name:: the attribute name (string or symbol) to modify
    # a value:: either a string or an array of strings.
    #
    # The :add operator will, unsurprisingly, add the specified values to
    # the specified attribute. If the attribute does not already exist,
    # :add will create it. Most LDAP servers will generate an error if you
    # to add a value that already exists.
    #
    # :replace will erase the current value(s) for the specified attribute,
    # if there are any, and replace them with the specified value(s).
    #
    # :delete will remove the specified value(s) from the specified attribute.
    # If you pass nil, an empty string, or an empty array as the value parameter
    # to a :delete operation, the _entire_ _attribute_ will be deleted.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #  dn = "mail=modifyme@example.com,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
    #  ops = [
    #    [:add, :mail, "aliasaddress@example.com"],
    #    [:replace, :mail, ["newaddress@example.com", "newalias@example.com"]],
    #    [:delete, :sn, nil]
    #  ]
    #  ldap.modify :dn => dn, :operations => ops
    #
    # <i>(This example is contrived since you probably wouldn't add a mail
    # value right before replacing the whole attribute, but it shows that order
    # of execution matters. Also, many LDAP servers won't let you delete SN
    # because it would be a schema violation.)</i>
    #
    # It's essential to keep in mind that if you specify more than one operation in
    # a call to #modify, most LDAP servers will attempt to perform all of the operations
    # in the order you gave them.
    # This matters because you may specify operations on the
    # same attribute which must be performed in a certain order.
    # Most LDAP servers will _stop_ processing your modifications if one of them
    # causes an error on the server (such as a schema-constraint violation).
    # If this happens, you will probably get a result code from the server that
    # reflects only the operation that failed, and you may or may not get extended
    # information that will tell you which one failed. #modify has no notion
    # of an atomic transaction. If you specify a chain of modifications in one
    # call to #modify, and one of them fails, the preceding ones will usually
    # not be "rolled back," resulting in a partial update. This is a limitation
    # of the LDAP protocol, not of Net::LDAP.
